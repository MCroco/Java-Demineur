# Java-Demineur
Demineur

During our second year at EPHEC you had to do a project based on JAVA. Our choice was fast but yet challenging, because we choose
to create a minesweeper which will be able to connect two people in a network.

We had to implement new concepts as MVC and the sockets (needed for our network part of the project).
